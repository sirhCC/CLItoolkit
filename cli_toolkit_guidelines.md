# CLI Toolkit Framework Development Guidelines

## 🎯 Code Quality & Readability

- **Guard Clauses:** Use guard clauses to keep functions clean. Validate preconditions upfront and return early to avoid deep nesting.
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Ensure each class or function has only one responsibility.
- **Fluent Interfaces:** Design methods that are chainable for intuitive use.
- **Immutability:** Favor immutable objects to avoid unintended side-effects.

## ⚙️ Error Handling

- **Centralized Exception Management:** Use a unified error handling mechanism across the CLI.
- **Fail-Fast Principle:** Immediately halt execution when critical errors occur, clearly informing users of the issue.
- **Exception Wrapping:** Wrap lower-level exceptions with meaningful, context-rich messages.

## 🔧 Configuration & Customization

- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Allow injection of dependencies to enhance modularity and testability.
- **Configuration Layering:** Support multiple configuration sources with defined precedence (CLI args > Environment Variables > Config Files).

## 🚀 Performance & Efficiency

- **Lazy Loading:** Load commands and resources only when needed.
- **Async/Await:** Support asynchronous operations, especially for I/O-bound tasks.
- **Memoization/Caching:** Cache expensive computations or frequent operations for performance optimization.

## 📚 Maintainability & Extensibility

- **Plugin System:** Allow developers to easily extend functionality through plugins or extensions.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Provide hooks or event emitters for custom logic at strategic points.
- **Modular Design:** Clearly separate parsing, validation, execution, and output formatting logic.

## 🧪 Testing & Reliability

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Write tests first to ensure robust coverage.
- **Snapshot Testing:** Capture and validate CLI output and behavior to catch regressions.
- **Integration & End-to-End Testing:** Include tests that simulate real-world usage scenarios.

## 🧩 Developer Experience (DX)

- **Intuitive & Fluent API:** Ensure APIs feel natural and straightforward.
- **Automatic Documentation Generation:** Generate documentation directly from CLI command definitions.
- **Graceful Fallbacks & Smart Suggestions:** Provide helpful suggestions for typos or incorrect usage.

## 📊 Logging & Observability

- **Structured Logging:** Output logs in structured formats like JSON for easier parsing.
- **Verbose/Debug Modes:** Include flags (`--verbose`, `--debug`) for detailed troubleshooting.
- **Usage Telemetry:** Provide optional opt-in analytics to guide future improvements, respecting user privacy.

## 🔍 Code Safety & Stability

- **Static Type Checking:** Utilize tools like TypeScript or mypy to enforce type safety.
- **Strict Input Validation:** Clearly define and rigorously validate all user inputs.
- **Schema Validation:** Use schema validation (e.g., JSON Schema, Zod) for configurations and inputs.

## 🔮 Advanced Features & Polish

- **Interactive Wizards:** Implement guided interactions for complex commands.
- **Auto-Completion & Shell Integration:** Offer command auto-completion for Bash, Zsh, Fish, etc.
- **Rich Output:** Provide visually appealing, formatted outputs with colorization, progress indicators, tables, and spinners.
- **Dry-Run Mode:** Allow users to preview actions before execution.

Following these guidelines will ensure the CLI toolkit is robust, efficient, maintainable, and offers an excellent developer experience.
